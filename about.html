    <P class="p">A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.Meals are generally
        served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.
        Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models
        ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced
        luxury establishments.The word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word restaurer
        'provide food for', literally 'restore to a former state' and, being the present participle of the verb, The
        term restaurant may have been used in 1507 as a "restorative beverage", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean
        'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'he restaurants in Hangzhou also catered to many
        northern Chinese who had fled south from Kaifeng during the Jurchen invasion of the 1120s, while it is also
        known that many restaurants were run by families formerly from Kaifeng. In Japan, a restaurant culture emerged
        in the 16th century out of local tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no RikyÅ« created the kaiseki multi-course meal
        tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include speciality dishes and cutlery which matched the
        aesthetic of the food.In Europe, inns which offered food and lodgings and taverns where food was served
        alongside alcoholic beverages were common into the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They typically served common
        fare of the type normally available to peasants. In Spain, such establishments were called bodegas and served
        tapas. In England, they typically served foods such as sausage and shepherd's pie.[10] Cookshops were also
        common in European cities during the Middle Ages. These were establishments which served dishes such as pies,
        puddings, sauces, fish, and baked meats. Customers could either buy a ready-made meal or bring their own meat to
        be cooked. As only large private homes had the means for cooking, the inhabitants of European cities were
        significantly reliant on them.A public eating establishment similar to a restaurant is mentioned in a 512 BC record from Ancient Egypt. It served only one dish, a plate of cereal, wild fowl, and onions. A forerunner of the modern restaurant is the thermopolium, an establishment in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that sold and served ready-to-eat food and beverages. These establishments were somewhat similar in function to modern fast food restaurants. They were most often frequented by people who lacked private kitchens. In the Roman Empire they were popular among residents of insulae. In Pompeii, 158 thermopolia with service counters have been identified throughout the town. They were concentrated along the main axis of the town and the public spaces where they were frequented by the locals.The Romans also had the popina, a wine bar which in addition to a variety of wines offered a limited selection of simple foods such as olives, bread, cheese, stews, sausage, and porridge. The popinae were known as places for the plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society to socialize. While some were confined to one standing room only, others had tables and stools and a few even had couches.Another early forerunner of the restaurant was the inn. Throughout the ancient world, inns were set up alongside roads to cater to people travelling between cities, offering lodging and food. Meals were typically served at a common table to guests. However, there were no menus or options to choose from.The Arthashastra references establishments where prepared food was sold in ancient India. One regulation states that "those who trade in cooked rice, liquor, and flesh" are to live in the south of the city. Another states that superintendents of storehouses may give surpluses of bran and flour to "those who prepare cooked rice, and rice-cakes", while a regulation involving city superintendents references "sellers of cooked flesh and cooked rice"</P>
