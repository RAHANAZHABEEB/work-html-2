    <h1 class="h1">RESTAURANT</h1>
    <P class="p">A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.Meals are generally
        served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services.
        Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models
        ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced
        luxury establishments.The word derives from the early 19th century, taken from the French word restaurer
        'provide food for', literally 'restore to a former state' and, being the present participle of the verb, The
        term restaurant may have been used in 1507 as a "restorative beverage", and in correspondence in 1521 to mean
        'that which restores the strength, a fortifying food or remedy'he restaurants in Hangzhou also catered to many
        northern Chinese who had fled south from Kaifeng during the Jurchen invasion of the 1120s, while it is also
        known that many restaurants were run by families formerly from Kaifeng. In Japan, a restaurant culture emerged
        in the 16th century out of local tea houses. Tea house owner Sen no RikyÅ« created the kaiseki multi-course meal
        tradition, and his grandsons expanded the tradition to include speciality dishes and cutlery which matched the
        aesthetic of the food.In Europe, inns which offered food and lodgings and taverns where food was served
        alongside alcoholic beverages were common into the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They typically served common
        fare of the type normally available to peasants. In Spain, such establishments were called bodegas and served
        tapas. In England, they typically served foods such as sausage and shepherd's pie.[10] Cookshops were also
        common in European cities during the Middle Ages. These were establishments which served dishes such as pies,
        puddings, sauces, fish, and baked meats. Customers could either buy a ready-made meal or bring their own meat to
        be cooked. As only large private homes had the means for cooking, the inhabitants of European cities were
        significantly reliant on them.</P>
